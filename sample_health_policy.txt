Effective Date: January 1, 2025
Policyholder: John Smith

SECTION 1: PLAN OVERVIEW
This Comprehensive Health Insurance Policy ("Policy") is a contract between the Policyholder and InsurHealth Inc. This Policy provides coverage for medically necessary services subject to the terms, conditions, exclusions, and limitations described herein.

SECTION 2: DEFINITIONS
2.1 Deductible: The amount you must pay for covered healthcare services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The annual deductible is $1,500 for individual coverage and $3,000 for family coverage.

2.2 Copayment: A fixed amount you pay for a covered healthcare service. Copayments vary by service type and are due at the time of service.

2.3 Coinsurance: Your share of the costs of a covered healthcare service, calculated as a percentage of the allowed amount for the service. Coinsurance is 20% for most services after you've met your deductible.

2.4 Out-of-Pocket Maximum: The most you have to pay for covered services in a plan year. After you spend this amount on deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance, your health plan pays 100% of the costs of covered benefits.
